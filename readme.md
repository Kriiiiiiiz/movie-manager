This is also major movie library management system project , which you can submit the name of the movie you are looking for and reproduce trailers

There are websites like www.imdb.com and www.rottentomatoes.com with rich amount of the
aforementioned data but the user has to open at least 3-4 websites to view all the data. So, this project was
started with the intention of developing a one-stop destination for the user to view all the data.
The data from these websites was fetched by calling the APIs and putting them together in a dynamic web
application named as “Movie Manager”

This web application is a Personalized Movie Database System (PMDS) where the user can login with several types of users, and search
movies. 
Admin user will be able to Edit, delete , create and rename details.
